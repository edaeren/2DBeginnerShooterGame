# 2DBeginnerShooterGame
I made this 2D shooter game with C# in Unity, for taking a step into the game development world. It's a bit basic game but it contains a main character, enemies which can also shoot at us, a life bar for us to track our character's remaining life and the total point that we gain from shooting the enemy. Our character can move around with "WASD" or with arrow keys. We can shoot at our enemies with space bar. If we shoot an enemy, the points will be increase and if an enemy shoots us, our life will be decreased. If our life bar reach the 0 point, the game will be paused and end. I did not make any screens for starting again for something like that. This game was just a starter for me.
