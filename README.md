# 2DBeginnerShooterGame
I made this 2D shooter game for taking a step into the game development world. It's a bit basic game but it contains a main character, enemies which can also shoot at us, a life bar for us to track our character's remaining life and the total point that we gain from shooting the enemy. Our character can move around with "WASD" or with arrow keys.
